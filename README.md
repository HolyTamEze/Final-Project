# Final-Project
The final project is currently a work in progress.

There were difficulties for this final project in creating an changing maze. 
The first is creating the actual maze itself. I was thinking of searching the web to find ways to create a maze and reference them for creating the maze.
However, I felt like this is more like a learning experience, so I knew that doing that would not be a good idea.
The second lies in the code of the creation of the maze. I have been changing and fixing code for hours but found no progress or led me back to the beginning.
I wanted the code to be specific on the walls and the randomness of inside the walls, but since I had little to no experience in creating mazes, I was stuck there for many hours.

I did enjoy creating the maze itself as of right now, but it takes a lot of work to program a changing maze. Now that I realize it, it was pretty hard overall, but I had fun figuring out what things are needed for a maze, and I learned that it takes time to work out the program and do a lot of trials and errors along the way.
